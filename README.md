# CrossChx Code Test

This code was revisited after several years to see how I would complete this now. Surprisingly not much has changed and d3.js was similar. The company is now defunct, but the problem was still a fun one. Please run this via a simple https server or use the following snippet for starting a simple server via python

`python3 -m http.server --directory public/`

## Part 2

Partially done, I did not have the full agent sheet to complete the map portion. It is available at index2.html when serving.
